# learn-python-through-selenium

Learn Python as you run the Selenium tests

The code you are going to run is a Selenium test for the Weather Shopper application.The automated test itself completes the weather shopper exercise. Your job is to fix the problems in the automated test and make it run successfully.

Setup
This codebase uses Python 3.7.x.
Fork this repository
Clone your forked repository
Create a virtualenv and activate it
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install Chrome driver

There are 6 tests and each can be run using following commands

--- pytest -k add_all_items_to_cart_and_checkout

--- pytest -k add_all_moiturizers_to_cart

--- pytest -k most_expensive_sunscreen

--- pytest -k most_expensive_moisturizer

--- pytest -k select_two_least_expensive_sunscreens

--- pytest -k select_two_least_expensive_moisturizers

--- pytest -k read_weather_and_redirect

The setup instructions are intentionally high-level since this repository is aimed at people with people who have already written Python before. If you are beginner, you will find our other repository a better place to start.
